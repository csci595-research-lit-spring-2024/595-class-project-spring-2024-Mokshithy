\chapter{Results}
\label{ch:results}

This chapter presents the results obtained from the experimental evaluation of ChatGPT's performance in solving data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems using nine distinct role-based prompts. The analysis focuses on a subset of 569 leetcode problems categorized as 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard', testing the effectiveness of each prompt in guiding ChatGPT to generate correct and efficient solutions.

\section{Distribution of Problem Difficulty}
Figure~\ref{fig:difficulty_distribution} shows the distribution of problems by difficulty level used in the experiments. This distribution was crucial in ensuring that the evaluation of each prompt's effectiveness was comprehensive, spanning simple to complex problem scenarios.

\section{Overall Performance by Prompt}

\subsection{Accepted Solutions per Prompt}
Table~\ref{tab:accepted_solutions_per_prompt} provides the number of solutions accepted for each prompt. It is evident that certain prompts led to a higher number of accepted solutions, indicating their effectiveness in guiding ChatGPT to generate valid solutions.

\section{Detailed Analysis of Prompt Performance}
The performance of each prompt, particularly Prompt 6, is further detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:prompt6_performance}, where 62.7\% of the test cases were accepted. This suggests a strong alignment between the prompt's specifications and ChatGPT's capability to deliver optimized solutions. Further analysis of the results by difficulty level is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prompt6_difficulty}, which provides a clear breakdown of acceptance rates across easy, medium, and hard problem categories.

Generally, more number of errors are observed in the Hard category and a significantly lower number observed in the Easy category as shown in the consequent figures. This can be attributed to not only the difficulty level of problems but also, more specifically it points out that ChatGPT 3.5 turbo is in-adept in tackling the "twists" (twists in leetcode DSA questions refers to the re-framing of the problem in it's complicated form) observed in the more difficult problems. 

Upon taking a closer look at the best performing prompt i.e., prompt 6, it reveals that specificity of what is required from the model in the context of DSA questions in order to solve them effectively plays a pivotal role, which lacks to certain degree in some other promps. In essence, vagueness and abstract wording do not help.

However, results also show (see fig.~\ref{fig:topic_wise_acceptance}) that prompting increases the models solving capabilities significantly and for some topics, even doubling the general acceptance rate. This shows the effectiveness of prompting the right contexts in solving DSA questions.

\subsection{Observing erroneous patterns}
The following figures ~\ref{fig:prompt1_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt2_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt3_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt4_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt5_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt6_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt7_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt8_difficulty}, ~\ref{fig:prompt9_difficulty} reveal the erroneous code generation which leads to failure. A simple correlation can be observed between the total number of errors to the overall acceptance rate. This suggests that guiding ChatGPT to produce less errors can be the key to unlocking higher orders of performance. Further study and analysis needs to be done to identify the causes for errors and the effect of prompting in guiding the model to produce error free code. 

\section{Summary}
The results presented in this chapter reveal significant insights into the effectiveness of different prompts in guiding ChatGPT to successfully solve DSA problems. The analysis indicates that specific prompts, especially those requiring concise and precise code solutions, tend to yield higher acceptance rates. This chapter sets the stage for a deeper discussion on the implications of these findings, which will be explored in the subsequent chapters of the thesis. For a detailed analysis of acceptance rates per topic for each prompt, refer to Appendix A.
