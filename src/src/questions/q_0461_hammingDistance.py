    """The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

    Given two integers `x` and `y`, return *the **Hamming distance** between them*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: x = 1, y = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    1   (0 0 0 1)
    4   (0 1 0 0)
           ↑   ↑
    The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: x = 3, y = 1
    Output: 1
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `0 <= x, y <= 2^{31} - 1`
