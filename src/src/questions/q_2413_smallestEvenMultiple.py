class Solution:
    """Given a **positive** integer `n`, return *the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of **both*** `2` *and* `n`.


    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 5
    Output: 10
    Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 5 and 2 is 10.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 6
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 6 and 2 is 6. Note that a number is a multiple of itself.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 150`
