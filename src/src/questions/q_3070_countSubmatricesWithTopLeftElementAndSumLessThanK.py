class Solution:
    """You are given a **0-indexed** integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`.

    Return *the **number** of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the* `grid`, *and have a sum less than or equal to* `k`.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/01/example1.png)
    ```
    Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/01/example21.png)
    ```
    Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `m == grid.length`
    * `n == grid[i].length`
    * `1 <= n, m <= 1000`
    * `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
    * `1 <= k <= 10^{9}`
