class Solution:
    """You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the stock price on the `i^{th}` day.

    A **smooth descent period** of a stock consists of **one or more contiguous** days such that the price on each day is **lower** than the price on the **preceding day** by **exactly** `1`. The first day of the period is exempted from this rule.

    Return *the number of **smooth descent periods***.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: prices = [3,2,1,4]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: There are 7 smooth descent periods:
    [3], [2], [1], [4], [3,2], [2,1], and [3,2,1]
    Note that a period with one day is a smooth descent period by the definition.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: prices = [8,6,7,7]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: There are 4 smooth descent periods: [8], [6], [7], and [7]
    Note that [8,6] is not a smooth descent period as 8 - 6 â‰  1.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: prices = [1]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: There is 1 smooth descent period: [1]
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= prices.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `1 <= prices[i] <= 10^{5}`
