    """Return the number of permutations of 1 to `n` so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)

    *(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)*

    Since the answer may be large, return the answer **modulo `10^9 + 7`**.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 5
    Output: 12
    Explanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 100
    Output: 682289015
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 100`
