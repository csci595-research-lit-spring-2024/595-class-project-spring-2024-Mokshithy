class Solution:
    """You are given an integer `n`. We reorder the digits in any order (including the original order) such that the leading digit is not zero.

    Return `true` *if and only if we can do this so that the resulting number is a power of two*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 1
    Output: true
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 10
    Output: false
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 10^{9}`
