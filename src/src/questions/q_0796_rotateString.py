class Solution:
    """Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` *if and only if* `s` *can become* `goal` *after some number of **shifts** on* `s`.

    A **shift** on `s` consists of moving the leftmost character of `s` to the rightmost position.

    * For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then it will be `"bcdea"` after one shift.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
    Output: true
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
    Output: false
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100`
    * `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase English letters.
