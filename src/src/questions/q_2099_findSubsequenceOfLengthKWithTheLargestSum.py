class Solution:
    """You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence** of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** sum.

    Return***any** such subsequence as an integer array of length* `k`.

    A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2
    Output: [3,3]
    Explanation:
    The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 3 = 6.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3
    Output: [-1,3,4]
    Explanation:
    The subsequence has the largest sum of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2
    Output: [3,4]
    Explanation:
    The subsequence has the largest sum of 3 + 4 = 7.
    Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
    * `-10^{5}Â <= nums[i] <= 10^{5}`
    * `1 <= k <= nums.length`
    """

    def maxSubsequence(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        pass
