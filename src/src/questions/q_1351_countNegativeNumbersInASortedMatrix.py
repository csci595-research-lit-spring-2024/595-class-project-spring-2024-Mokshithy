class Solution:
    """Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return *the number of **negative** numbers in* `grid`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
    Output: 8
    Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
    Output: 0
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `m == grid.length`
    * `n == grid[i].length`
    * `1 <= m, n <= 100`
    * `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`



    **Follow up:** Could you find an `O(n + m)` solution?"""
