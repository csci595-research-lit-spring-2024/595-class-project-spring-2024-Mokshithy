class Solution:
    """You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

    Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

    Return *the head of the merged linked list*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)
    ```
    Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
    Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
    Output: []
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
    Output: [0]
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
    * `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
    * Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
