class Solution:
    """Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return *the number of* `words[i]` *that is a subsequence of* `s`.

    A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

    * For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
    Output: 2
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^{4}`
    * `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
    * `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
    * `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
