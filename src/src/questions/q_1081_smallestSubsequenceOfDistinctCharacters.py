class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, return *the* *lexicographically smallest* *subsequence* *of* `s` *that contains all the distinct characters of* `s` *exactly once*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "bcabc"
    Output: "abc"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
    Output: "acdb"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.



    **Note:** This question is the same as 316: <https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicate-letters/>"""
