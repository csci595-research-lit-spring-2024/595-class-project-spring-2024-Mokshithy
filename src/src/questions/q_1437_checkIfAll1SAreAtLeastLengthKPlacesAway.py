class Solution:
    """Given an binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` *if all* `1`*'s are at least* `k` *places away from each other, otherwise return* `false`.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_1_1791.png)
    ```
    Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
    Output: true
    Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)
    ```
    Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
    Output: false
    Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `0 <= k <= nums.length`
    * `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`
