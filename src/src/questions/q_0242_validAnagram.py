class Solution:
    """Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` *if* `t` *is an anagram of* `s`*, and* `false` *otherwise*.

    An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
    Output: true
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
    Output: false
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^{4}`
    * `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.



    **Follow up:** What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
