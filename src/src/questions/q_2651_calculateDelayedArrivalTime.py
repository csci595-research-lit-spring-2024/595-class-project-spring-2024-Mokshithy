class Solution:
    """You are given a positive integer `arrivalTime` denoting the arrival time of a train in hours, and another positive integer `delayedTime` denoting the amount of delay in hours.

    Return *the time when the train will arrive at the station.*

    Note that the time in this problem is in 24-hours format.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: arrivalTime = 15, delayedTime = 5
    Output: 20
    Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 15:00 hours. It is delayed by 5 hours. Now it will reach at 15+5 = 20 (20:00 hours).
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: arrivalTime = 13, delayedTime = 11
    Output: 0
    Explanation: Arrival time of the train was 13:00 hours. It is delayed by 11 hours. Now it will reach at 13+11=24 (Which is denoted by 00:00 in 24 hours format so return 0).
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= arrivaltime <Â 24`
    * `1 <= delayedTime <= 24`
