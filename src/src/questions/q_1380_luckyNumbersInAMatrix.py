class Solution:
    """Given an `m x n` matrix of **distinct** numbers, return *all **lucky numbers** in the matrix in **any** order*.

    A **lucky number** is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
    Output: [15]
    Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
    Output: [12]
    Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
    Output: [7]
    Explanation: 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `m == mat.length`
    * `n == mat[i].length`
    * `1 <= n, m <= 50`
    * `1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^{5}`.
    * All elements in the matrix are distinct.
