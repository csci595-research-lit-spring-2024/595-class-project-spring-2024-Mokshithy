class Solution:
    """Given an integer array `nums`, return *the number of elements that have **both** a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in* `nums`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [11,7,2,15]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The element 7 has the element 2 strictly smaller than it and the element 11 strictly greater than it.
    Element 11 has element 7 strictly smaller than it and element 15 strictly greater than it.
    In total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [-3,3,3,90]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The element 3 has the element -3 strictly smaller than it and the element 90 strictly greater than it.
    Since there are two elements with the value 3, in total there are 2 elements having both a strictly smaller and a strictly greater element appear in nums.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
    * `-10^{5} <= nums[i] <= 10^{5}`
