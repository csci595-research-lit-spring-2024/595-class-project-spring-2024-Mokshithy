class Solution:
    """Given a positive integer `num`, return *the number of positive integers **less than or equal to*** `num` *whose digit sums are **even***.

    The **digit sum** of a positive integer is the sum of all its digits.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation:
    The only integers less than or equal to 4 whose digit sums are even are 2 and 4.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num = 30
    Output: 14
    Explanation:
    The 14 integers less than or equal to 30 whose digit sums are even are
    2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, and 28.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= num <= 1000`
