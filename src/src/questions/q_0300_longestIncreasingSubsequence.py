class Solution:
    """Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **strictly increasing*** ***subsequence***.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
    Output: 4
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
    Output: 1
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
    * `-10^{4} <= nums[i] <= 10^{4}`



    **Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
