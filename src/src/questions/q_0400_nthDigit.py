    """Given an integer `n`, return the `n^{th}` digit of the infinite integer sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ...]`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 11
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The 11^{th} digit of the sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, ... is a 0, which is part of the number 10.
