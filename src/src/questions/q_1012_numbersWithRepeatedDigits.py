class Solution:
    """Given an integer `n`, return *the number of positive integers in the range* `[1, n]` *that have **at least one** repeated digit*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 20
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The only positive number (<= 20) with at least 1 repeated digit is 11.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 100
    Output: 10
    Explanation: The positive numbers (<= 100) with atleast 1 repeated digit are 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, and 100.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: n = 1000
    Output: 262
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 10^{9}`
