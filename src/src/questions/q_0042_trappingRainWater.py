class Solution:
    """Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)
    ```
    Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
    Output: 9
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `n == height.length`
    * `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^{4}`
    * `0 <= height[i] <= 10^{5}`
    """

    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
