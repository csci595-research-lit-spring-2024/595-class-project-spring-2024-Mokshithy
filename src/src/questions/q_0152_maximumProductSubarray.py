class Solution:
    """Given an integer array `nums`, find a subarray that has the largest product, and return *the product*.

    The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^{4}`
    * `-10 <= nums[i] <= 10`
    * The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
