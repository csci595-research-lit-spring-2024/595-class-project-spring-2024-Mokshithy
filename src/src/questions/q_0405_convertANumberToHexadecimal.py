class Solution:
    """Given an integer `num`, return *a string representing its hexadecimal representation*. For negative integers, [twoâ€™s complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) method is used.

    All the letters in the answer string should be lowercase characters, and there should not be any leading zeros in the answer except for the zero itself.

    **Note:**You are not allowed to use any built-in library method to directly solve this problem.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num = 26
    Output: "1a"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num = -1
    Output: "ffffffff"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `-2^{31} <= num <= 2^{31} - 1`
