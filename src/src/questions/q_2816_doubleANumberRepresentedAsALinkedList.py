class Solution:
    """You are given the `head` of a **non-empty** linked list representing a non-negative integer without leading zeroes.

    Return *the* `head` *of the linked list after **doubling** it*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/28/example.png)
    ```
    Input: head = [1,8,9]
    Output: [3,7,8]
    Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 189. Hence, the returned linked list represents the number 189 * 2 = 378.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/05/28/example2.png)
    ```
    Input: head = [9,9,9]
    Output: [1,9,9,8]
    Explanation: The figure above corresponds to the given linked list which represents the number 999. Hence, the returned linked list reprersents the number 999 * 2 = 1998.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 10^{4}]`
    * `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
    * The input is generated such that the list represents a number that does not have leading zeros, except the number `0` itself.
