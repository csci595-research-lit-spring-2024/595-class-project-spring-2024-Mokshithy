class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "bcabc"
    Output: "abc"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
    Output: "acdb"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 10^{4}`
    * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.



    **Note:** This question is the same as 1081: <https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/>
