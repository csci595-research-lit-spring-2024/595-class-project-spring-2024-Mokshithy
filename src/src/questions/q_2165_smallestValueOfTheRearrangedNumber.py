class Solution:
    """You are given an integer `num.` **Rearrange** the digits of `num` such that its value is **minimized** and it does not contain **any** leading zeros.

    Return *the rearranged number with minimal value*.

    Note that the sign of the number does not change after rearranging the digits.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num = 310
    Output: 103
    Explanation: The possible arrangements for the digits of 310 are 013, 031, 103, 130, 301, 310.
    The arrangement with the smallest value that does not contain any leading zeros is 103.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num = -7605
    Output: -7650
    Explanation: Some possible arrangements for the digits of -7605 are -7650, -6705, -5076, -0567.
    The arrangement with the smallest value that does not contain any leading zeros is -7650.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `-10^{15} <= num <= 10^{15}`
