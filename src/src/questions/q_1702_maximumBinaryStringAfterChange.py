class Solution:
    """You are given a binary string `binary` consisting of only `0`'s or `1`'s. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:

    * Operation 1: If the number contains the substring `"00"`, you can replace it with `"10"`.
            + For example, `"00010" -> "10010`"
    * Operation 2: If the number contains the substring `"10"`, you can replace it with `"01"`.
            + For example, `"00010" -> "00001"`

    *Return the **maximum binary string** you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string `x` is greater than binary string `y` if `x`'s decimal representation is greater than `y`'s decimal representation.*



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: binary = "000110"
    Output: "111011"
    Explanation: A valid transformation sequence can be:
    "000110" -> "000101"
    "000101" -> "100101"
    "100101" -> "110101"
    "110101" -> "110011"
    "110011" -> "111011"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: binary = "01"
    Output: "01"
    Explanation:Â "01" cannot be transformed any further.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= binary.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `binary` consist of `'0'` and `'1'`.
