class Solution:
    """Given an integer `n`, return *`true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`*.

    An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3^{x}`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 27
    Output: true
    Explanation: 27 = 3^{3}
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 0
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no x where 3^{x} = 0.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: n = -1
    Output: false
    Explanation: There is no x where 3^{x} = (-1).
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `-2^{31} <= n <= 2^{31} - 1`



    **Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?"""
