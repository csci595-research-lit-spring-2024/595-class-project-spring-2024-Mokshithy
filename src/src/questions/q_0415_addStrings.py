class Solution:
    """Given two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return *the sum of* `num1` *and* `num2` *as a string*.

    You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
    Output: "134"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
    Output: "533"
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
    Output: "0"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10^{4}`
    * `num1` and `num2` consist of only digits.
    * `num1` and `num2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
