class Solution:
    """Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

    There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return *this repeated number*.

    You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
    Output: 2
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
    Output: 3
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [3,3,3,3,3]
    Output: 3
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 10^{5}`
    * `nums.length == n + 1`
    * `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
    * All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.



    **Follow up:**

    * How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in `nums`?
    * Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?
