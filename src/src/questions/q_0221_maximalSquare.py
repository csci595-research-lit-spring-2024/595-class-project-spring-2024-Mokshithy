class Solution:
    """Given an `m x n` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, *find the largest square containing only* `1`'s *and return its area*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max1grid.jpg)
    ```
    Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
    Output: 4
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/max2grid.jpg)
    ```
    Input: matrix = [["0","1"],["1","0"]]
    Output: 1
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: matrix = [["0"]]
    Output: 0
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `m == matrix.length`
    * `n == matrix[i].length`
    * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
    * `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
