class Solution:
    """You are given two positive integers `n` and `limit`.

    Return *the **total number** of ways to distribute* `n` *candies among* `3` *children such that no child gets more than* `limit` *candies.*



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 5, limit = 2
    Output: 3
    Explanation: There are 3 ways to distribute 5 candies such that no child gets more than 2 candies: (1, 2, 2), (2, 1, 2) and (2, 2, 1).
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 3, limit = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: There are 10 ways to distribute 3 candies such that no child gets more than 3 candies: (0, 0, 3), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (0, 3, 0), (1, 0, 2), (1, 1, 1), (1, 2, 0), (2, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0) and (3, 0, 0).
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 10^{6}`
    * `1 <= limit <= 10^{6}`
