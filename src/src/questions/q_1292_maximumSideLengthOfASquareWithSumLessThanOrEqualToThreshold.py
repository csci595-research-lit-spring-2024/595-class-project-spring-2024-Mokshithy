class Solution:
    """Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return *the maximum side-length of a square with a sum less than or equal to* `threshold` *or return* `0` *if there is no such square*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/05/e1.png)
    ```
    Input: mat = [[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2],[1,1,3,2,4,3,2]], threshold = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The maximum side length of square with sum less than 4 is 2 as shown.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: mat = [[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2],[2,2,2,2,2]], threshold = 1
    Output: 0
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `m == mat.length`
    * `n == mat[i].length`
    * `1 <= m, n <= 300`
    * `0 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^{4}`
    * `0 <= threshold <= 10^{5}`
    """

    # If you have multiple solutions, add them all here as methods of the same class.
