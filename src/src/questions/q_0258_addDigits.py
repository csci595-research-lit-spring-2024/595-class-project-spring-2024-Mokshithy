class Solution:
    """Given an integer `num`, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit, and return it.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num = 38
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The process is
    38 --> 3 + 8 --> 11
    11 --> 1 + 1 --> 2
    Since 2 has only one digit, return it.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num = 0
    Output: 0
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `0 <= num <= 2^{31} - 1`



    **Follow up:** Could you do it without any loop/recursion in `O(1)` runtime?
