class Solution:
    """You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `pref`.

    Return *the number of strings in* `words` *that contain* `pref` *as a **prefix***.

    A **prefix** of a string `s` is any leading contiguous substring of `s`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: words = ["pay","**at**tention","practice","**at**tend"], pref = "at"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The 2 strings that contain "at" as a prefix are: "**at**tention" and "**at**tend".
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: words = ["leetcode","win","loops","success"], pref = "code"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: There are no strings that contain "code" as a prefix.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= words.length <= 100`
    * `1 <= words[i].length, pref.length <= 100`
    * `words[i]` and `pref` consist of lowercase English letters.
