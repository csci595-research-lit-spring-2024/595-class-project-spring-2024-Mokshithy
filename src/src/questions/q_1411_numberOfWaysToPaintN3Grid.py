class Solution:
    """You have a `grid` of size `n x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: **Red**, **Yellow,** or **Green** while making sure that no two adjacent cells have the same color (i.e., no two cells that share vertical or horizontal sides have the same color).

    Given `n` the number of rows of the grid, return *the number of ways* you can paint this `grid`. As the answer may grow large, the answer **must be** computed modulo `10^{9} + 7`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 12
    Explanation: There are 12 possible way to paint the grid as shown.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 5000
    Output: 30228214
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `n == grid.length`
    * `1 <= n <= 5000`
