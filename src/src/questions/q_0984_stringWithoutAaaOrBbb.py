class Solution:
    """Given two integers `a` and `b`, return **any** string `s` such that:

    * `s` has length `a + b` and contains exactly `a` `'a'` letters, and exactly `b` `'b'` letters,
    * The substring `'aaa'` does not occur in `s`, and
    * The substring `'bbb'` does not occur in `s`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: a = 1, b = 2
    Output: "abb"
    Explanation: "abb", "bab" and "bba" are all correct answers.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: a = 4, b = 1
    Output: "aabaa"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `0 <= a, b <= 100`
    * It is guaranteed such an `s` exists for the given `a` and `b`.
