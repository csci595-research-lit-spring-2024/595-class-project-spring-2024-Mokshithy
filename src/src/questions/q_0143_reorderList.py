# Definition for singly-linked list.

#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    """You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

    ```
    L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
    ```
    *Reorder the list to be on the following form:*

    ```
    L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
    ```
    You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)
    ```
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
    Output: [1,4,2,3]
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)
    ```
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 5 * 10^{4}]`.
    * `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`
