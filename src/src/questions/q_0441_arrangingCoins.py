class Solution:
    """You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i^{th}` row has exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase **may be** incomplete.

    Given the integer `n`, return *the number of **complete rows** of the staircase you will build*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins1-grid.jpg)
    ```
    Input: n = 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Because the 3^{rd} row is incomplete, we return 2.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/09/arrangecoins2-grid.jpg)
    ```
    Input: n = 8
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Because the 4^{th} row is incomplete, we return 3.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 2^{31} - 1`
