class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

    Return *the minimum number of steps* to make `s` palindrome.

    A **Palindrome String** is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "zzazz"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we do not need any insertions.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "mbadm"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: s = "leetcode"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 500`
    * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
