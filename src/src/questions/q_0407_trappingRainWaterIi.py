class Solution:
    """Given an `m x n` integer matrix `heightMap` representing the height of each unit cell in a 2D elevation map, return *the volume of water it can trap after raining*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/trap1-3d.jpg)
    ```
    Input: heightMap = [[1,4,3,1,3,2],[3,2,1,3,2,4],[2,3,3,2,3,1]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: After the rain, water is trapped between the blocks.
    We have two small ponds 1 and 3 units trapped.
    The total volume of water trapped is 4.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/trap2-3d.jpg)
    ```
    Input: heightMap = [[3,3,3,3,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,2,1,2,3],[3,2,2,2,3],[3,3,3,3,3]]
    Output: 10
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `m == heightMap.length`
    * `n == heightMap[i].length`
    * `1 <= m, n <= 200`
    * `0 <= heightMap[i][j] <= 2 * 10^{4}`
    """

        pass
