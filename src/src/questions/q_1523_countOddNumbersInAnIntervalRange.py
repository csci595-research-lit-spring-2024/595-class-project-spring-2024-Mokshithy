class Solution:
    """Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the *count of odd numbers between* `low` *and* `high`*(inclusive)*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```

    Input: low = 3, high = 7
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```

    Input: low = 8, high = 10
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The odd numbers between 8 and 10 are [9].
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `0 <= low <= highÂ <= 10^9`"""
