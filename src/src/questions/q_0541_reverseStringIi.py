class Solution:
    """Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

    If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
    Output: "bacdfeg"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
    Output: "bacd"
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 10^{4}`
    * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
    * `1 <= k <= 10^{4}`
