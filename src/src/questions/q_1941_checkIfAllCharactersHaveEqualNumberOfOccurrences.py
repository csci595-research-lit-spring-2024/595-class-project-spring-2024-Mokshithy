class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, return `true` *if* `s` *is a **good** string, or* `false` *otherwise*.

    A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the **same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abacbc"
    Output: true
    Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "aaabb"
    Output: false
    Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
    'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    * `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
