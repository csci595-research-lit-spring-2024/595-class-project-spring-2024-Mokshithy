class Solution:
    """The **power** of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

    Given a string `s`, return *the **power** of* `s`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "leetcode"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 500`
    * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
