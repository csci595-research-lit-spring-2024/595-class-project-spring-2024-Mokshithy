class Solution:
    """You are given a string `num` consisting of digits only.

    Return *the **largest palindromic** integer (in the form of a string) that can be formed using digits taken from* `num`. It should not contain **leading zeroes**.

    **Notes:**

    * You do **not** need to use all the digits of `num`, but you must use **at least** one digit.
    * The digits can be reordered.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: num = "444947137"
    Output: "7449447"
    Explanation:
    Use the digits "4449477" from "**44494****7**13**7**" to form the palindromic integer "7449447".
    It can be shown that "7449447" is the largest palindromic integer that can be formed.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: num = "00009"
    Output: "9"
    Explanation:
    It can be shown that "9" is the largest palindromic integer that can be formed.
    Note that the integer returned should not contain leading zeroes.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= num.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `num` consists of digits.
