class Solution:
    """Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

    If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
    Output: "fl"
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
    Output: ""
    Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= strs.length <= 200`
    * `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
    * `strs[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.
