class Solution:
    """Nearly everyone has used the [Multiplication Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication_table). The multiplication table of size `m x n` is an integer matrix `mat` where `mat[i][j] == i * j` (**1-indexed**).

    Given three integers `m`, `n`, and `k`, return *the* `k^{th}` *smallest element in the* `m x n` *multiplication table*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/multtable1-grid.jpg)
    ```
    Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The 5^{th} smallest number is 3.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/multtable2-grid.jpg)
    ```
    Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The 6^{th} smallest number is 6.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 10^{4}`
    * `1 <= k <= m * n`
