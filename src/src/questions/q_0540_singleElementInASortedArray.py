class Solution:
    """You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

    Return *the single element that appears only once*.

    Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
    Output: 2
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
    Output: 10
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^{5}`
