class Solution:
    """You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.

    An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`'s not connected to any other `1`'s. There are **exactly two islands** in `grid`.

    You may change `0`'s to `1`'s to connect the two islands to form **one island**.

    Return *the smallest number of* `0`*'s you must flip to connect the two islands*.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
    Output: 1
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
    Output: 2
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
    Output: 1
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
    * `2 <= n <= 100`
    * `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
    * There are exactly two islands in `grid`.
