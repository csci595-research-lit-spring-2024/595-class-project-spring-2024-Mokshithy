class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest** **substring** without repeating characters.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^{4}`
    * `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
