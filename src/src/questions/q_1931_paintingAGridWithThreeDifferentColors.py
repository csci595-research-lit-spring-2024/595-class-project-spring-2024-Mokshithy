class Solution:
    """You are given two integers `m` and `n`. Consider an `m x n` grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell **red**, **green**, or **blue**. All cells **must** be painted.

    Return *the number of ways to color the grid with **no two adjacent cells having the same color***. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `10^{9} + 7`.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/22/colorthegrid.png)
    ```
    Input: m = 1, n = 1
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The three possible colorings are shown in the image above.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/22/copy-of-colorthegrid.png)
    ```
    Input: m = 1, n = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The six possible colorings are shown in the image above.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: m = 5, n = 5
    Output: 580986
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= m <= 5`
    * `1 <= n <= 1000`
