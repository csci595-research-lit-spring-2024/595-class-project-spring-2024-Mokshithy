class Solution:
    """You are given a **positive** integer `n`.

    Let `even` denote the number of even indices in the binary representation of `n` (**0-indexed**) with value `1`.

    Let `odd` denote the number of odd indices in the binary representation of `n` (**0-indexed**) with value `1`.

    Return *an integer array* `answer` *where* `answer = [even, odd]`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 17
    Output: [2,0]
    Explanation: The binary representation of 17 is 10001.
    It contains 1 on the 0^{th} and 4^{th} indices.
    There are 2 even and 0 odd indices.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 2
    Output: [0,1]
    Explanation: The binary representation of 2 is 10.
    It contains 1 on the 1^{st} index.
    There are 0 even and 1 odd indices.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 1000`
