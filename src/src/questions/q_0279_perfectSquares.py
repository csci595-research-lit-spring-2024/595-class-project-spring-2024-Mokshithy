    """Given an integer `n`, return *the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to* `n`.

    A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 12
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 13
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= n <= 10^{4}`
