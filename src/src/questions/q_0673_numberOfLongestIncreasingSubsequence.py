class Solution:
    """Given an integer arrayÂ `nums`, return *the number of longest increasing subsequences.*

    **Notice** that the sequence has to be **strictly** increasing.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
    Output: 5
    Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 increasing subsequences of length 1, so output 5.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`
    * `-10^{6} <= nums[i] <= 10^{6}`
