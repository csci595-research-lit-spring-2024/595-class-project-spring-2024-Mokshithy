class Solution:
    """Given a binary string `s`, return *the number of substrings with all characters* `1`*'s*. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^{9} + 7`.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "0110111"
    Output: 9
    Explanation: There are 9 substring in total with only 1's characters.
    "1" -> 5 times.
    "11" -> 3 times.
    "111" -> 1 time.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "101"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Substring "1" is shown 2 times in s.
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: s = "111111"
    Output: 21
    Explanation: Each substring contains only 1's characters.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 10^{5}`
    * `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
