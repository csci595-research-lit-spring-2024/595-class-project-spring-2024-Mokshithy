class Solution:
    """Given an alphanumeric string `s`, return *the **second largest** numerical digit that appears in* `s`*, or* `-1` *if it does not exist*.

    An **alphanumeric**string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and digits.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "dfa12321afd"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1, 2, 3]. The second largest digit is 2.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "abc1111"
    Output: -1
    Explanation: The digits that appear in s are [1]. There is no second largest digit.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 500`
    * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters and/or digits.
