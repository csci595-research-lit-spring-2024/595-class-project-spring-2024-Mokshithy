class Solution:
    """Given a `rows x cols`Â binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and return *its area*.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/maximal.jpg)
    ```
    Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: matrix = [["0"]]
    Output: 0
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: matrix = [["1"]]
    Output: 1
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `rows == matrix.length`
    * `cols == matrix[i].length`
    * `1 <= row, cols <= 200`
    * `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
