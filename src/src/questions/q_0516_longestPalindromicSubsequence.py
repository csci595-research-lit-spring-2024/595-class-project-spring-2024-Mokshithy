class Solution:
    """Given a string `s`, find *the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in* `s`.

    A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: s = "bbbab"
    Output: 4
    Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: s = "cbbd"
    Output: 2
    Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
    * `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
