    """Given the `head` of a linked list, remove the `n^{th}` node from the end of the list and return its head.



    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)
    ```
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
    Output: [1,2,3,5]
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: head = [1], n = 1
    Output: []
    ```
    **Example 3:**

    ```
    Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
    Output: [1]
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
    * `1 <= sz <= 30`
    * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
    * `1 <= n <= sz`



    **Follow up:** Could you do this in one pass?
