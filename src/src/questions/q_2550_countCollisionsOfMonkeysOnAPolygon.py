class Solution:
    """There is a regular convex polygon with `n` vertices. The vertices are labeled from `0` to `n - 1` in a clockwise direction, and each vertex has **exactly one monkey**. The following figure shows a convex polygon of `6` vertices.

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/01/22/hexagon.jpg)
    Each monkey moves simultaneously to a neighboring vertex. A neighboring vertex for a vertex `i` can be:

    * the vertex `(i + 1) % n` in the clockwise direction, or
    * the vertex `(i - 1 + n) % n` in the counter-clockwise direction.

    A **collision** happens if at least two monkeys reside on the same vertex after the movement or intersectÂ on an edge.

    Return *the number of ways the monkeys can move so that at least **one collision***  *happens*. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^{9 }+ 7`.

    **Note** that each monkey can only move once.



    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 6
    Explanation: There are 8 total possible movements.
    Two ways such that they collide at some point are:
    - Monkey 1 moves in a clockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 2 collide.
    - Monkey 1 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 2 moves in an anticlockwise direction; monkey 3 moves in a clockwise direction. Monkeys 1 and 3 collide.
    It can be shown 6 total movements result in a collision.
    ```
    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 4
    Output: 14
    Explanation: It can be shown that there are 14 ways for the monkeys to collide.
    ```


    **Constraints:**

    * `3 <= n <= 10^{9}`
